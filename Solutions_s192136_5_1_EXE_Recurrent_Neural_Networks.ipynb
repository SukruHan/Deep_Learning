    "In this lab, we will introduce different ways of learning from sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a recurring example, we will train neural networks to do language modelling, i.e. predict the next token in a sentence. In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals, or videos, just to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really get a grasp of what is going on inside a recurrent neural network (RNN), we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in NumPy rather than PyTorch. We start off with a simple toy problem, build an RNN using NumPy, train and it, and see for ourselves that it really works. Once we're convinced, we proceed to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell, also in NumPy. This is *not* simply to cause you frustration, but rather to provide you with a deeper understanding of the recurrence in RNNs, which will become very beneficial to you in the following weeks. Once you understand the inner workings of an RNN, we will proceed to a PyTorch implementation that you may use for the remainder of the course and in your projects.\n",

    "With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathrm{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. \n",
    "This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n",
    "We will model functions as $\\mathrm{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{R}^c$, where $c$ is the amount of classes in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to represent sequences. With text, the challenge is how to represent a word as a feature vector in $d$ dimensions, as we are required to represent text with decimal numbers in order to apply neural networks to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use a simple one-hot encoding but for categorical variables that can take on many values (e.g. words in the English language) this may be infeasible. For such scenarios, you can project the encodings into a smaller space by use of embeddings. If you want to learn more about tokens, encodings and embeddings than what is covered in this exercise, we highly recommend [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEMJRjEdNzM&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z)."

    "Implement the missing code in the backward pass above using a cross-entropy loss and $\\tanh{x}$ as non-linear activation function $f$. Refer to previous weeks for the definition of cross-entropy, see week 1 exercise i) for an explanation of its derivative, or follow [this link](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/#grad) for a hint.\n",

    "**Note:** to compute a cross-entropy loss that is independent of the number of target classes, it is common to divide the loss by the number of targets (i.e. take the mean rather than a sum). It is optional whether you do this or not.\n",

Therefore, to compute e.g. the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial W}$, we need to 1) sum up across time, and 2) apply the chain rule:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, recall the definition of the RNN forward pass. We have the following computations through the network:\n",

To compute $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial U_{t}},~\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial V_{t}}$ you will therefore need to determine $\\frac{\\partial f_{t}}{\\partial U_{t}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f_{t}}{\\partial V_{t}}$, respectively, using the function definitions.\n",

    "Now that we can do forward passes and compute gradients with backpropagation, we're ready to train our network. For that we will need an optimizer. A common and easy to implement optimization method is stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which has the update rule: $\\theta_{n+1} = \\theta_{n} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\theta_{n}}$, where $\\eta$ is the learning rate and $E$ is our cost function. This is essentially what's going on behind the scenes when you run `optimizer.step()` in PyTorch using the SGD optimizer. If you want to learn more about optimization in a deep learning context, [this is a great starting point](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747)."

To combat these issues the gated hidden units were created. The two most prominent gated hidden units are the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both of which have shown increased performance in saving and reusing memory in later timesteps. In this exercise, we will focus on LSTM but you would easily be able to go ahead and implement the GRU as well based on the principles that you learn here.\n",

LSTM’s have a nature of remembering information for a long periods of time is their default behaviour because of _'gates'_. Therefore it doesn't need a lower learning rate. Higher learning rate and less epoch works better exactly like in our eaxmple."

    "As we have already seen, RNNs are excellent for sequential data such as language. But what do we do if we're modelling data with strong dependency in both directions? Like in many things deep learning, we can build powerful models by stacking layers on top of each other; *bi-directional* RNNs consist of two LSTM cells, one for each direction. A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell. Follow [this link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf) for the original paper from 1997(!).\n",

    "For even deeper representations, multiple layers of both uni-directional and bi-directional RNNs can be stacked ontop of each other, just like feed-forward and convolutional layers. For more information on this, check out the [LSTM PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#lstm). Next week we will also explore ways to combine RNNs with other types of layers for even more expressive function approximators."
